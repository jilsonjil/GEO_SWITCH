Location-Based and Time-Based Reminder App
This app allows users to set reminders that trigger either based on time or location. The app uses Firebase for storage and Google Location Services to track the user's current location. Once the user reaches a target location or the scheduled time arrives, a push notification is triggered to remind them about the task.
